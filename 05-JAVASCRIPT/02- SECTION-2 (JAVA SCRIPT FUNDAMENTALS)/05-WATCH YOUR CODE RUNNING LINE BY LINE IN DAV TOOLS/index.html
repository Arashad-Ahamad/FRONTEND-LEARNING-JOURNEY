    <h1>Code Execution in JavaScript</h1>
    <!-- Memory Creation Phase -->
    <p>
        <strong>Memory Creation Phase:</strong> - JavaScript engine first
        allocates memory for all variables and functions. - Variables declared
        with <code>var</code> are assigned **undefined**. - Variables declared
        with <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> are allocated memory but
        remain **uninitialized** in the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** until the
        code execution phase. - Function declarations are stored as a complete
        reference, so they can be called even before their definition.
    </p>
    <!-- Execution Phase -->
    <p>
        <strong>Execution Phase:</strong> - Code is executed line by line. -
        <code>var</code> variables are assigned their actual values during
        execution. - <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> are initialized when
        the code execution reaches their line. - Accessing `let` or `const` before
        initialization will throw a **ReferenceError**. - Functions are executed
        when they are called.
