            <p>THE MATCH clock, and the world around Lamine Yamal, stopped at 20:16 at the Allianz Arena in Munich. It
                was
                the
                precise moment when the wondrous strike from his left-instep curled and curved in its 20-yard journey,
                shook
                the
                iron post and nestled into the French nets, past the airborne shot-stopper Mike Maignan.</p>
            <p>The goal stirred a famous comeback victory for Spain over France to enter the Euro Championship 2024
                final,
                and
                would soar into the hall of fame of the greatest goals ever in the tournament, and adorn the wall of
                football
                tragic in the years to come.</p>
            <p>The goal was remarkable on several layers, from his poise in front of a packed defence to snatch the
                ball,
                the
                vision in discovering the perfect path to goal amidst French shirts, the dexterity of his feet to trick
                his
                pre-match provocateur Adrien Rabiot and friends to one side, nudge the ball to the opposite side with a
                delicate
                touch of the out-step and the conviction to bend the ball beyond the goalkeeper from the distance.</p>

                    alt=" Cristiano Ronaldo ">
                <p>Having played under three managers in his second stint at Old Trafford, Ronaldo had some success
                    under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but endured difficult stints under former manager Ralf Rangnick and Erik
                    ten Hag.</p>

                <p>The former Real Madrid man had to endure a somewhat tough season at Old Trafford this season, only
                    managing three goals and two assists in 16 matches across all competitions.</p>

                <p>This has largely been due to his lack of game time and his contract with Man Utd was terminated on
                    Tuesday by mutual consent. His fiery interview with Piers Morgan put him in the limelight briefly as
                    he didnâ€™t really hold back.</p>

                <p> Ronaldo is still the only Man Utd player to get 30+ goals in a season in the history of the Premier
                    league. This shows the kind of impact that he can have on the field when things are going well.</p>

                <p>Scaloni said: "99% of the time, [Messi] is fit to play. It's never happened to me that he's not fit
                    to play. Every time he's come out on the pitch, he's fit to play. For [Canada], he's fit to play,
                    without a doubt. It's a very easy decision for me, because it's a very frank decision, that if he's
                    fine, he plays; and if he's not fine, he plays the last 30 minutes. It's that easy.  </p>

                    <p> "When he's fit, he always plays. There are no doubts. Who would have any doubts? I'm the coach, so I
                    have no doubts. I'm the one who decides and when I see that he's fit to play, even if he's not 100%
                    fit, he's going to play. I take responsibility for that but I have no doubts. It's true that that
                    won't ever weigh on me, I know what he can give us even if he's not in optimal condition, I wouldn't
                    make the grave mistake of not putting him on the pitch knowing that he gives us a lot, so that's
                    indisputable."</p>
